# WebOS Sublime Text plugin

This is a fork of the official [Sublime Text plugin](http://webostv.developer.lge.com/sdk/sublime-text-plugin/) made by LG Electronics, which adds support for Sublime Text 3 and potentially new features over time.

This plugin will also be added to the [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) repository when I've done more testing, in order to make it easier to install and update.


## Installation

This plugin relies on having the [SDK](http://webostv.developer.lge.com/sdk/download/download-sdk/) installed, and the plugin can currently be installed manually by either cloning the Git repository or just downloading the files and extracting them into the `Packages` folders of Sublime Text.

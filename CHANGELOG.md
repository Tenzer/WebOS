# WebOS Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2017-03-20
* Initial release with a bunch of changes from the WebOS SDK version:
    - Made Python 3 (and thus Sublime Text 3) compatible
    - Removed context menu and sidebar menu items
    - Removed default keyboard shortcuts
    - Removed functionality to create and open the `appinfo.json file`
    - Better detection of WebOS projects
    - Added sublime-command access to the plugin features
    - Made "Run in Browser" more intelligent so it automatically will do a build of the project if it doesn't have an `index.html` file
    - Many small bugfixes and code cleanups
